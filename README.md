# Chest X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning

<img src="xray-header-image.png" style="padding-top: 50px;width: 87%;left: 0px;margin-left: 0px;margin-right: 0px;">

In this notebook we will explore medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras. 

The notebook will walk through some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model. In particular, we will:
- Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
- Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
- Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
- Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
- Visualize model activity using GradCAMs
